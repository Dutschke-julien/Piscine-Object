# Piscine-Object
Skills : Organization , Adaptation &amp; creativity,  Object-oriented programming 

What is a piscine?
Much like the selection piscine, the project is split in many small projects (days), and
with each day a new notion on the language/paradigm/technology you chose to work on.
Validating a piscine requires more than just a day or two of investment. We are looking
at:



* Your investment on each days: you can’t validate the piscine if you work only one or two days

* Trying to turn in every day: even if something isn’t finished, it’s better to try and turn it in

* At least one weekend of work: going into the piscine shouldn’t be taken lightly.

* After the end of the piscine, you have two weeks to do all the required peer-evaluations
